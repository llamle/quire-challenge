# quire-challenge

## Synopsis

This is my solution to the "Gamified Investor Education Quiz" Coding Challenge by Quire.

The requirements were:

* Template can be built using basic HTML
* Style with CSS + any graphics/icons/fonts desired
* Create correct/incorrect answer interactions with JS and third-party libraries as desired

## Motivation

I built this project to showcase my ability to build functional and enjoyable forms, with the goal of allowing individuals to learn difficult financial terms easily and quickly.

I added a cartoon Kanye (the bear from college dropout) because I felt it would help make a topic that is foreign to many people a bit more approachable and enjoyable.

## Installation

To install this either clone my repo or download it as a zip. In console run then simply launch the index.html file.

## API Reference

This project was built using AngularJS.

## Contributors

Special Thanks to Brandon for building the challenge. And to Kyle at Codepen for the use of his bear (http://codepen.io/kaisle/pen/bNPxdx).
